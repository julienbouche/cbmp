      This project aims to create a map with all the informations you can imagine about the great craft brewers around the world.
      It is aimed to be owned by its users and this is why the project is totally open-source and new informations can be added by everyone.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      
      The site is relying on open-source frameworks such as : <a href="http://openlayers.org/">OpenLayers</a> and <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>.
      The code is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/julienbouche/cbmp">Github</a>.
      Feel free to help this project by coding, by adding informations on places or adding new great places.
      <br/>

      Don't forget to have a beer and drink responsibly.
